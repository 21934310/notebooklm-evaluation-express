Critical Analysis of NotebookLM Capabilities
Accuracy and Relevance of AI-Generated Output
When I uploaded sources alongside one convincingly formatted but wholly fabricated “decoy” paper and asked Notebook LM to list every source it had cited, it reproduced all 273 references. A manual cross-check in Google Scholar confirmed that every genuine citation resolved correctly, while the 10 decoys were repeated uncritically. The result 96.3 % precision shows that the system echoes bibliographic data with near-perfect fidelity if the underlying document is real. However, it has no native mechanism for spotting a counterfeit reference, so any error in the corpus becomes an error in the answer.

Error propagation.
To probe further, I altered a legitimate abstract, inflating the AI in education is expected to be worth from “$6mn” to “$16mn.” In subsequent Q & A the model quoted the fictitious figure verbatim and even wove it into comparative arguments. This confirms that Notebook LM’s retrieval-augmented design means trust by default: it will faithfully relay whatever is present in user-supplied files, accurate or otherwise.

Usefulness in real academic workflows
Literature-review compression.
A graduate student scenario involved condensing twelve approximately 25-page PDFs into a 500-word state of the art summary. Manually this takes almost three hours; Notebook LM produced a solid first draft in 30 seconds. Inline citations let the student open each supporting passage instantly, so polishing the text required minutes, not hours.

Quality of the output. 
When I invoked “Create study guide,” the system produced a well-structured revision pack key terms, concise concept summaries, a chronological timeline, and ten self-test questions in under a minute. I then spot-checked every factual element that appeared in the guide against the original AI Education materials. Each item matched its source verbatim, and no stray or mis-sourced content was introduced. The controlled corpus and perfect alignment in this representative audit suggest that, when the underlying documents are trustworthy, Notebook LM can generate study aids that are both coherently organised and factually exact making it a dependable first-draft engine for student revision.

Limitations, risks and mitigation considerations
Grounded hallucinations.
Because Notebook LM never steps outside user documents, classic free-text hallucinations are rare, but the corollary is that any mistake you feed it is amplified. The fabricated citations and inflated statistics in my tests were repeated without warnings. For student work this creates an invisible failure mode: a polished answer that is wrong at source. Mandatory database verification of every reference is therefore non-negotiable.
Out-of-scope hallucination test. To probe whether Notebook LM would invent content when asked about topics absent from the notebook, I posed a question on “Fishery Education” a subject totally unrelated to, and therefore missing from, the uploaded AI Education corpus. The model immediately replied that it could not locate any relevant passages in the provided sources and suggested either uploading new material or refining the query. Crucially, it did not fabricate definitions, statistics, or citations to fill the gap; instead, its answer stayed within the system’s retrieval boundary and preserved factual integrity. This behaviour confirms that Notebook LM’s grounding mechanism sharply limits classic large-language-model hallucinations, provided the prompt strays outside the user’s document set.

Privacy and compliance
Files on the free tier are stored on Google servers, with no customer-managed encryption keys and limited contractual guarantees for educational data. Google emphasises that notebook content “is not used to train public models,” yet admits that privacy protections differ by account tier. Until the institution can license Notebook LM Plus or the forthcoming enterprise version with stronger controls, sensitive or unpublished research materials should remain outside the platform.

Bias-handling observation. 
To probe whether Notebook LM favours one stance over another when confronted with competing narratives, I fed it two deliberately contradictory excerpts on AI tutoring effectiveness and asked for a neutral synthesis and a bullet-list of direct contradictions. As the screenshots show, the tool first produced a balanced one-paragraph overview that acknowledged both the “20 - 30 % mastery gain” claim and the “no statistically significant difference” finding, then itemised three clear points of disagreement with precise source attribution. It introduced no outside opinions, did not weight one passage more heavily than the other, and explicitly flagged the tension around learning outcomes, tutor replacement, and critical-thinking impacts. This response indicates that, when opposing viewpoints are supplied in the corpus, Notebook LM surfaces them even-handedly rather than privileging a dominant narrative reducing the likelihood of covert perspective bias within its retrieval boundary.
